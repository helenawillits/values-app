### Value Assessment

This simple react app issues an assessment to identify the order of the user's values. These values come from Shalom Schwartz's circumplex model.


#### This value assessment has two parts:

**Part 1** — 20 self-report statements rated 1–7. This captures your conscious value endorsements.

**Part 2** — 8 tradeoff dilemmas where you pick a side and rate how strongly you feel. These are often more revealing than self-report because they force you to sacrifice one value for another — which is closer to how values actually operate in real life.

The results page ranks all 10 Schwartz values by strength, tiers them (Core → Low Priority), and flags any tensions where you scored high on values that theoretically oppose each other.
One caveat worth noting: any self-administered assessment has limits. People tend to inflate socially desirable values (universalism, benevolence) and downplay less flattering ones (power, hedonism). The tradeoff scenarios help counteract that, but the best complement to this would be reflecting on your actual past decisions — where you put your time, money, and energy when it cost you something.
